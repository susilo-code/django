trying django
after a long time, finally I start to try using one of the most popular frameworks in python,namely django.
Actually, i have heard this fw since 5 years ago, but i never practice intensively.
Sometimes, when i have a bit free time, or just for killing the time, I explore this fw.
For you guys who find this repo coincidence, don't expect too much to get in-depth django knowledge or you will be disappointed, hehehe
